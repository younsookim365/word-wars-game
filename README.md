# Word Wars Game
This Java application is a prototype for a word game inspired by Scrabble. It allows two players to take turns entering words, and the game calculates scores based on the entered words. The players are presented with the alphabet. They take turns entering words using the available letters in the alphabet list. When a player enters a word, the letters of that word are removed from the alphabet list, except for vowels. Both players must agree if a word is valid, and if accepted, the player earns one point for each word. Letters used in a word are removed from the alphabet list and cannot be reused. If a player attempts to use missing letters, they are prompted to enter a new word. The game continues until a player is unable to create any more words with the remaining alphabet list. When a player cannot proceed, they must enter the sentinel value "???" to quit the game. The winner is then determined by comparing the accumulated points of the players. The player with the highest points is declared the winner, or the game is considered tied if both players have the same score.
